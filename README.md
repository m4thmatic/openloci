# openloci
OpenLoci is a full scale multi-user web-based ERP &amp; Field Service software package. It was designed initially for the field service industry, with the idea that
it may have eventually included construction &amp; retail modules.

This software is largely complete, but has, for the time being, been abandoned due to lack of time (or desire) to work on it. It uses Xataface as a front end, and was my first major 
project to use PHP and SQL - and as such may not follow best practices for web development (I largely write embedded C & device drivers). 

This was originally written to support my parents' family business, and is the product of 2 years worth of part-time work. In retrospect, may have been a bit overly ambitious to 
complete solo, but I didn't know at the time what I was getting myself into.
